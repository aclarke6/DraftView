## 2. Open Bugs

- [ ] **UX — Republish button should show would-be version number**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20 (found during UAT)
  - The Republish button on the Sections view should show the version number that will be created, e.g. "Republish" with text "to version 3" underneath the button as a comment.
  - This gives the author visibility of what they are about to create before committing
  - Belongs in RSprint-1

- [DONE] **BUG-013 — Reader Account Settings missing font and font size preferences**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20 (found during UAT)
  - Fixed: 2026-04-20
  - Symptoms: Reader navigates to `Account/Settings`. Profile, Appearance (theme), Email Address and Change Password sections present but ProseFont and ProseFontSize reading preferences are missing entirely
  - Expected: Font face and font size preferences (built in Sprint 3) should be visible and editable in Account Settings for readers
  - Resolution: `AccountController.Settings` now uses `BaseController` role helpers (`IsAuthorAsync` / `IsReaderAsync`) instead of inline role strings, correctly identifying `BetaReader` users so Reading Preferences (font and size) render as intended; prose preference load/save path unchanged
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-013-reader-settings-missing-font-preferences.prompt.md`

- [DONE] **BUG-012 — Adding a new scene to a published chapter does not trigger a republish prompt**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20 (found during UAT)
  - Fixed: 2026-04-20
  - Resolution: sync reconciliation now marks a published parent chapter as changed when a new unpublished child scene is created from Scrivener binder reconciliation. This enables chapter-level change indicators and Republish controls.
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-012-new-scene-in-published-chapter-no-republish-prompt.prompt.md`

- [DONE] **BUG-014 — Republishing a chapter creates new versions for unchanged scenes**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20 (found during UAT)
  - Fixed: 2026-04-20
  - Resolution: chapter republish now creates a new version only for scenes changed since last publish or scenes with no existing versions. Unchanged already-versioned scenes are skipped.
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-014-republish-creates-versions-for-unchanged-scenes.prompt.md`

- [DONE] **BUG-007 — Activating a project does not deactivate the currently active project**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20
  - Fixed: activating a project now deactivates any currently active different project in the same save operation (atomic unit-of-work) (2026-04-20)
  - Future: invariant becomes one active project per Tenancy under multi-tenancy
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-007-activate-project-does-not-deactivate-current.prompt.md`

- [ ] **BUG-001 — Reader removal not reflecting in UI** — needs retest, may already be fixed
  - Action completes but reader remains visible in list
  - Investigate: `AuthorController.SoftDeleteReader`, `SoftDeleteUserAsync`, reader list filter
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-001-reader-removal-not-reflecting.prompt.md`

- [ ] **BUG-003 — Reader settings shows `Ciphertext is not in the expected format` on screen**
  - Protected-email decryption failure surfacing as a form validation error; should route to controlled 500 path
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-003-settings-ciphertext-error.prompt.md`

- [ ] **BUG-002 — System Support has no readers page**
  - No UI surface to verify deny-by-default email behaviour for SystemSupport role
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-002-system-support-no-readers-page.prompt.md`

## 3. Active Projects

### 3.1 Go-Live Prerequisites
- [ ] Add `Anthropic:ApiKey` to `appsettings.Production.json` (enables AI summaries)
- [ ] Invitation acceptance flow does not expose stored email
- [ ] Forgot-password flow works end-to-end in production
- [ ] Production smoke check: no `localhost` links, no plaintext email leakage
- [ ] Data handling aligns with UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018
- [ ] Copy production `EmailProtection:EncryptionKey` and `EmailProtection:LookupHmacKey` into secure password manager
- [ ] Go-Live Day: send password reset emails to Becca (becca@the-dunlops.co.uk) and Hilary (hilaryrrb@gmail.com)

### 3.2 Platform Hardening
- [ ] Fail2ban setup on production VM
- [ ] Report Fault modal (HomeController POST + `_Layout.cshtml` modal + CSS)
- [ ] SystemStateMessage expiry (`ExpiresAt` nullable DateTime, `GetActiveAsync` filters expired)
- [ ] Logging: failed authorization attempts
- [ ] Impersonation — read-only, explicit enter/exit mode (design agreed, not built)

### 3.3 RSprint-1 — Reader and Author Experience
Items identified during UAT 2026-04-20. Full sprint design to follow.

- [ ] Reader progress drill-down on Author scene view — clicking "Read by N reader(s)" shows which readers have opened the scene and when
- [ ] Reader scroll progress tracking — progress indicator per reader per scene (depends on scroll position work below)
- [ ] Kindle-style resume — exact scroll position (`ScrollPosition` on `ReadEvent`, debounced JS POST, restore on load)
- [ ] Reader progress in Recent Activity — author preference to show/hide reader open events; per-reader progress on Readers page
- [ ] Reader version visibility — decide whether readers should see the version number (deferred, review post-UAT)

### 3.4 Multi-Tenancy Sprint Series
See `MultiTenancy.md` for full design, migration strategy, and sprint plan.

| Sprint | Deliverable |
|--------|-------------|
| MT-Sprint-1 | Account / Tenancy / TenancyMembership entity split |
| MT-Sprint-2 | Subscription enforcement, `IBillingProvider`, Creem integration |
| MT-Sprint-3 | Author self-serve registration, Dropbox connect per Tenancy |
| MT-Sprint-4 | Reader cross-tenancy identity |
| MT-Sprint-5 | Reader Marketplace (post-revenue) |

**Prerequisite:** Billing abstraction in place and production stable before MT-Sprint-1.

### 3.5 Incremental Refactor Roadmap
See `REFACTORING.md` for full detail.
- [DONE] Phase 1 — Centralise controller user/role resolution
- [ ] Phase 2 — Extract procedural controller workflows
- [ ] Phase 3 — Decompose startup/seeding
- [ ] Phase 4 — Standardise inheritance and shared utilities
- [ ] Phase 5 — Extract remaining procedural workflows
- [ ] Phase 6 — Standardise sync kickoff (remove inline `Task.Run`)

### 3.6 Post Go-Live Backlog
- Reader notification emails (new chapter published)
- Dropbox OAuth2 token refresh
- Dropbox webhook controller for push-based sync
- In-app Dropbox re-auth page
- Author/Comments view (mobile)
- Author Chapter Page (`Author/Chapter/{id}`)
- Publishing cascades (part-level, book-level)

## 4. Done

### Bugs Fixed

- [DONE] BUG-008 — Author/Section view had unreadable light-on-light prose and inconsistent visual design; removed inline styling, applied dark-theme token-based styling, and aligned breadcrumb/metadata/comments with author UI patterns (2026-04-20)
- [DONE] BUG-009 — New scene added in Scrivener did not appear after incremental sync; fixed by running `ReconcileProjectFromScrivxAsync` in the incremental path so new binder UUIDs are created from the cached local `.scrivx` without additional Dropbox API round-trips (2026-04-20)

- [DONE] Cross-platform local cache path resolution — `IPlatformPathService`, platform-aware fallback (BugFix-Mac, 2026-04-19)
