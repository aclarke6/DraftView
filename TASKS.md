## 2. Open Bugs

- [ ] **BUG-008 — Author/Section view has poor visual design and unreadable text**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20 (found during UAT)
  - Symptoms: The `Author/Section/{id}` view renders a white content box against the dark theme background. Text is barely readable (light colour on white). The overall visual impact is jarring and inconsistent with all other author views.
  - Fix: Restyle the view to use the dark theme consistently — content box, typography, breadcrumb, metadata line, comments section. CSS/view fix only — no domain or application layer changes.
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-008-author-section-view-visual-design.prompt.md`

- [ ] **BUG-010 — Publishing page has no navigation link from Sections view or Dashboard**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20 (found during UAT)
  - Symptoms: Publishing page (`Author/Publishing?projectId={id}`) only reachable by typing the URL directly — no link from Sections view or Dashboard
  - Fix: Add Publishing link on Sections view for changed chapters; consider persistent link in project actions on Dashboard
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-010-publishing-page-no-navigation-link.prompt.md`
  - **Blocks UAT scenarios C, D, E**

- [ ] **BUG-007 — Activating a project does not deactivate the currently active project**
  - Reported: 2026-04-20
  - `ActivateForReaders` must atomically deactivate the existing active project
  - Future: invariant becomes one active project per Tenancy under multi-tenancy
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-007-activate-project-does-not-deactivate-current.prompt.md`

- [ ] **BUG-001 — Reader removal not reflecting in UI** — needs retest, may already be fixed
  - Action completes but reader remains visible in list
  - Investigate: `AuthorController.SoftDeleteReader`, `SoftDeleteUserAsync`, reader list filter
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-001-reader-removal-not-reflecting.prompt.md`

- [ ] **BUG-003 — Reader settings shows `Ciphertext is not in the expected format` on screen**
  - Protected-email decryption failure surfacing as a form validation error; should route to controlled 500 path
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-003-settings-ciphertext-error.prompt.md`

- [ ] **BUG-002 — System Support has no readers page**
  - No UI surface to verify deny-by-default email behaviour for SystemSupport role
  - prompt: `.github/Prompts/BUG-002-system-support-no-readers-page.prompt.md`

## 3. Active Projects

### 3.1 Go-Live Prerequisites
- [ ] Add `Anthropic:ApiKey` to `appsettings.Production.json` (enables AI summaries)
- [ ] Invitation acceptance flow does not expose stored email
- [ ] Forgot-password flow works end-to-end in production
- [ ] Production smoke check: no `localhost` links, no plaintext email leakage
- [ ] Data handling aligns with UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018
- [ ] Copy production `EmailProtection:EncryptionKey` and `EmailProtection:LookupHmacKey` into secure password manager
- [ ] Go-Live Day: send password reset emails to Becca (becca@the-dunlops.co.uk) and Hilary (hilaryrrb@gmail.com)

### 3.2 Platform Hardening
- [ ] Fail2ban setup on production VM
- [ ] Report Fault modal (HomeController POST + `_Layout.cshtml` modal + CSS)
- [ ] SystemStateMessage expiry (`ExpiresAt` nullable DateTime, `GetActiveAsync` filters expired)
- [ ] Logging: failed authorization attempts
- [ ] Impersonation — read-only, explicit enter/exit mode (design agreed, not built)

### 3.3 RSprint-1 — Reader and Author Experience
Items identified during UAT 2026-04-20. Full sprint design to follow.

- [ ] Reader progress drill-down on Author scene view — clicking "Read by N reader(s)" shows which readers have opened the scene and when
- [ ] Reader scroll progress tracking — progress indicator per reader per scene (depends on scroll position work below)
- [ ] Kindle-style resume — exact scroll position (`ScrollPosition` on `ReadEvent`, debounced JS POST, restore on load)
- [ ] Reader progress in Recent Activity — author preference to show/hide reader open events; per-reader progress on Readers page
- [ ] Reader version visibility — decide whether readers should see the version number (deferred, review post-UAT)
- [ ] BUG-008 — Author/Section view poor visual design and unreadable text
- [ ] BUG-007 — Activating a project does not deactivate current active project

### 3.4 Multi-Tenancy Sprint Series
See `MultiTenancy.md` for full design, migration strategy, and sprint plan.

| Sprint | Deliverable |
|--------|-------------|
| MT-Sprint-1 | Account / Tenancy / TenancyMembership entity split |
| MT-Sprint-2 | Subscription enforcement, `IBillingProvider`, Creem integration |
| MT-Sprint-3 | Author self-serve registration, Dropbox connect per Tenancy |
| MT-Sprint-4 | Reader cross-tenancy identity |
| MT-Sprint-5 | Reader Marketplace (post-revenue) |

**Prerequisite:** Billing abstraction in place and production stable before MT-Sprint-1.

### 3.5 Incremental Refactor Roadmap
See `REFACTORING.md` for full detail.
- [DONE] Phase 1 — Centralise controller user/role resolution
- [ ] Phase 2 — Extract procedural controller workflows
- [ ] Phase 3 — Decompose startup/seeding
- [ ] Phase 4 — Standardise inheritance and shared utilities
- [ ] Phase 5 — Extract remaining procedural workflows
- [ ] Phase 6 — Standardise sync kickoff (remove inline `Task.Run`)

### 3.6 Post Go-Live Backlog
- Reader notification emails (new chapter published)
- Dropbox OAuth2 token refresh
- Dropbox webhook controller for push-based sync
- In-app Dropbox re-auth page
- Author/Comments view (mobile)
- Author Chapter Page (`Author/Chapter/{id}`)
- Publishing cascades (part-level, book-level)

## 4. Done

### Bugs Fixed
- [DONE] BUG-009 — New scene added in Scrivener did not appear after incremental sync; fixed by running `ReconcileProjectFromScrivxAsync` in the incremental path so new binder UUIDs are created from the cached local `.scrivx` without additional Dropbox API round-trips (2026-04-20)
- [DONE] BUG-006 — Unable to sync projects — seeder author lookup now Identity-ID-first; invalid ciphertext repaired on startup; duplicate author row repair added (2026-04-20)
- [DONE] BUG-005 — Password reset link immediately expired — reset flow now resolves Identity user by email fallback (2026-04-19)
- [DONE] BUG-004 — ForgotPassword returns HTTP 405 in production — two missing migrations applied; status code routing fixed
- [DONE] Cross-platform local cache path resolution — `IPlatformPathService`, platform-aware fallback (BugFix-Mac, 2026-04-19)
- [DONE] `/Author/InviteReader` submit production crash — operational failures route to `Home/Error` (BugFix-Mac, 2026-04-19)
- [DONE] MailKit NU1902 vulnerability — upgraded to 4.16.0 (BugFix-PC, 2026-04-19)
- [DONE] Reader view does not apply saved Reading Preferences (2026-04-17)
- [DONE] CS9107 in `AccountController` primary constructor (2026-04-17)
- [DONE] Reader/Read mobile view 404
- [DONE] Reader/Read comment box overflows page boundary on RHS
- [DONE] AddComment POST redirects to top of page — fixed with `#scene-{id}` anchors
- [DONE] Author/Dashboard Recent Activity truncation — replaced with persisted `AuthorNotification`
- [DONE] Login always redirected to Reader/Dashboard — fixed role-based redirect
- [DONE] Reader diff UX for removed paragraphs — thin markers instead of strikethrough

### Sprints Complete
